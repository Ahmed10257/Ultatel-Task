The Repository is divided into two main parts: the Back-End and the Front-End. Each part is designed to work together to provide a comprehensive solution for the project's requirements.

## Back-End

The Back-End of the project is built using the [NestJS](https://nestjs.com/) framework, a progressive Node.js framework for building efficient and scalable server-side applications.

### API Documentation

The APIs are documented using Swagger. You can access the APIs documentation at the following link:
